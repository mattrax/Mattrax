If you enable this policy setting or if you do not configure this policy setting, the SMB client will allow insecure guest logons.

While uncommon in an enterprise environment, insecure guest logons are frequently used by consumer Network Attached Storage (NAS) appliances acting as file servers. Windows file servers require authentication and do not use insecure guest logons by default. Since insecure guest logons are unauthenticated, important security features such as SMB Signing and SMB Encryption are disabled. As a result, clients that allow insecure guest logons are vulnerable to a variety of man-in-the-middle attacks that can result in data loss, data corruption, and exposure to malware. Additionally, any data written to a file server using an insecure guest logon is potentially accessible to anyone on the network. Microsoft recommends disabling insecure guest logons and configuring file servers to require authenticated access.",

This policy setting determines whether SMB packet signing must be negotiated before further communication with an SMB server is permitted.  If this setting is enabled, the Microsoft network client will not communicate with a Microsoft network server unless that server agrees to perform SMB packet signing. If this policy is disabled, SMB packet signing is negotiated between the client and server.  Default: Disabled.  Important  For this policy to take effect on computers running Windows 2000, client-side packet signing must also be enabled. To enable client-side SMB packet signing, set Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (if server agrees).  Notes  All Windows operating systems support both a client-side SMB component and a server-side SMB component. On Windows 2000 and later operating systems, enabling or requiring packet signing for client and server-side SMB components is controlled by the following four policy settings: Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always) - Controls whether or not the client-side SMB component requires packet signing.

The server message block (SMB) protocol provides the basis for Microsoft file and print sharing and many other networking operations, such as remote Windows administration. To prevent man-in-the-middle attacks that modify SMB packets in transit, the SMB protocol supports the digital signing of SMB packets. This policy setting determines whether the SMB client component attempts to negotiate SMB packet signing when it connects to an SMB server.  If this setting is enabled, the Microsoft network client will ask the server to perform SMB packet signing upon session setup.

Notes  All Windows operating systems support both a client-side SMB component and a server-side SMB component. On Windows 2000 and later, enabling or requiring packet signing for client and server-side SMB components is controlled by the following four policy settings: Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always) - Controls whether or not the client-side SMB component requires packet signing. Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (if server agrees) - Controls whether or not the client-side SMB component has packet signing enabled. Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always) - Controls whether or not the server-side SMB component requires packet signing.

A domain controller always pulls the account policy from the Default Domain Policy Group Policy object (GPO), even if there is a different account policy applied to the organizational unit that contains the domain controller. By default, workstations and servers that are joined to a domain (for example, member computers) also receive the same account policy for their local accounts.

    "description": "Allows IT Admins to either prevent specific pages in the System Settings app from being visible or accessible, or to do so for all pages except those specified. The mode will be specified by the policy string beginning with either the string showonly: or hide:.  Pages are identified by a shortened version of their already published URIs, which is the URI minus the ms-settings: prefix. For example, if the URI for a settings page is ms-settings:bluetooth, the page identifier used in the policy will be just bluetooth. Multiple page identifiers are separated by semicolons. The following example illustrates a policy that would allow access only to the about and bluetooth pages, which have URI ms-settings:about and ms-settings:bluetooth respectively:showonly:about;bluetooth. If the policy is not specified, the behavior will be that no pages are affected. If the policy string is formatted incorrectly, it will be ignored entirely (i. e. treated as not set) to prevent the machine from becoming unserviceable if data corruption occurs. Note that if a page is already hidden for another reason, then it will remain hidden even if it is in a showonly: list. The format of the PageVisibilityList value is as follows: The value is a unicode string up to 10,000 characters long, which will be used without case sensitivity. There are two variants: one that shows only the given pages and one which hides the given pages. The first variant starts with the string showonly: and the second with the string hide:. Following the variant identifier is a semicolon-delimited list of page identifiers, which must not have any extra whitespace. Each page identifier is the ms-settings:xyz URI for the page, minus the ms-settings: prefix, so the identifier for the page with URI ms-settings:network-wifi would be just network-wifi. The default value for this setting is an empty string, which is interpreted as show everything. Example 1, specifies that only the wifi and bluetooth pages should be shown (they have URIs ms-settings:network-wifi and ms-settings:bluetooth). All other pages (and the categories they're in) will be hidden:showonly:network-wifi;bluetooth. Example 2, specifies that the wifi page should not be shown:hide:network-wifi",

This profile setting lets users install programs that require access to directories that the user might not have permission to view or change, including directories on highly restricted computers. If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the system applies the current user's permissions when it installs programs that a system administrator does not distribute or offer. Note: This policy setting appears both in the Computer Configuration and User Configuration folders. To make this policy setting effective, you must enable it in both folders. Caution: Skilled users can take advantage of the permissions this policy setting grants to change their privileges and gain permanent access to restricted files and folders.

The mode will be specified by the policy string beginning with either the string showonly: or hide:.  Pages are identified by a shortened version of their already published URIs, which is the URI minus the ms-settings: prefix. For example, if the URI for a settings page is ms-settings:bluetooth, the page identifier used in the policy will be just bluetooth. Multiple page identifiers are separated by semicolons. The following example illustrates a policy that would allow access only to the about and bluetooth pages, which have URI ms-settings:about and ms-settings:bluetooth respectively:showonly:about;bluetooth. If the policy is not specified, the behavior will be that no pages are affected. If the policy string is formatted incorrectly, it will be ignored entirely (i. e. treated as not set) to prevent the machine from becoming unserviceable if data corruption occurs. Note that if a page is already hidden for another reason, then it will remain hidden even if it is in a showonly: list. The format of the PageVisibilityList value is as follows: The value is a unicode string up to 10,000 characters long, which will be used without case sensitivity. There are two variants: one that shows only the given pages and one which hides the given pages. The first variant starts with the string showonly: and the second with the string hide:. Following the variant identifier is a semicolon-delimited list of page identifiers, which must not have any extra whitespace. Each page identifier is the ms-settings:xyz URI for the page, minus the ms-settings: prefix, so the identifier for the page with URI ms-settings:network-wifi would be just network-wifi. The default value for this setting is an empty string, which is interpreted as show everything. Example 1, specifies that only the wifi and bluetooth pages should be shown (they have URIs ms-settings:network-wifi and ms-settings:bluetooth). All other pages (and the categories they're in) will be hidden:showonly:network-wifi;bluetooth. Example 2, specifies that the wifi page should not be shown:hide:network-wifi",
