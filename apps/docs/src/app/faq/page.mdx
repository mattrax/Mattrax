# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why not another MDM solution?

Device management is not a new problem, but I believe we are taking a fresh approach to it.

<h4 class="text-xl ">Unified policies and applications</h4>

Mattrax is designed from the ground up to work with all of your devices regardless of operating system. This by itself is nothing new but Mattrax takes it a step furthur with unified policies. Define your configuration or applications once, and leave it to Mattrax to work out the operating systems differences.

{/* TODO: Example */}

<h4 class="text-xl ">Policy versioning</h4>

In Mattrax policy versioning is a first class citizen which opens up a whole new world of possibilities. <br/>
You accidently deploy a faulty configuration? on a Friday! No problem, roll back to the previous version and enjoy the weekend! <br/> 
You want to test a policy, just stage it to your test device to instantly see the changes, without fiddling with the policies scope.

<h4 class="text-xl ">Integrations</h4>

Mattrax is designed to be extensible. We know being an MDM is more than just managing the operating system, you've got software that needs locking down and licencing. <br />
To combat this Mattrax has a feature called policy templates. Software vendors or 3rd party contributors can provide definitions that instruct Mattrax how to deploy, configure and licence their software. <br />
You want to deploy Slack, Chrome, Microsoft Office, Chef, etc? No problem, just select the policy template and fill in the blanks. No wrangling with scripts or custom MDM profiles. Spend hours not days introducing new software to your fleet.

{/* TODO: Our Linux agent will be declarative */}

These features all come together to allow your IT team to ship changes faster and with less risk. Your users will be happier and you will have more time to fix the printers.

## How much will Mattrax cost?

While Mattrax is in beta it is free to use. We will be charging per device per month (with discounts for yearly purchases). <br />
We will also provide discounts for non-profits and students. <br />
Self-hosting will still require a valid Mattrax subscription to use the service.

## What OS's are supported?

Initially we will support **Windows, macOS and iOS** with Android, tvOS and Linux coming soon.

## Can I migrate to/from cloud to self-hosted?

Yeah for sure! We will offer a migration tool to help you move your data with zero-downtime.

## I'm an managed service provider, is Mattrax for me?

Right now Mattrax is focused on internal IT teams but if your an MSP and are interested in using Mattrax, please get in touch and we can discuss your needs.

## I'm building my own MDM, can I use Mattrax's infrastructure?

We are going to offer a REST API for you to use to interact with Mattrax's infrastructure. This will allow you to ship the power of Mattrax's MDM infrastructure while providing your own dashboard. <br />

Right now we are focusing on the core product but if you are interested in this, please get in touch and we can discuss your needs.
