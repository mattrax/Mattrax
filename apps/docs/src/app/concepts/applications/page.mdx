## Do you support application management?

We take care of application management including integrations with [Apple Volume Purchase Program](https://www.apple.com/business/vpp/), [Microsoft Store for Business](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/business), [Brew](https://brew.sh) and [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org). <br />
An application is defined and *targets* are linked to it which instruct Mattrax how to conduct the installation for each operating system. <br />

We can also take care of software updates for you. Select "Latest version" and never think about it again or manually select a version to pin to. We will even alert you when a new version is available for you to test and deploy.
