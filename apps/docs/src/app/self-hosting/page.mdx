# Self hosting

<WarningNote>
  Mattrax is currently not publicly available for self-hosting.

  We are focusing on the cloud product as it allows us to gain better insights. <br />
  If your interesting in self-hosting [reach out](mailto:hello@mattrax.app) and we can discuss your requirements.
</WarningNote>
